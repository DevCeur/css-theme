# CSS Theme with CSS Variables

The idea of this little project was to create a functional and easy to maintain
light and dark theme using just CSS and Javascript.

## How?

Well, it's main files are the `lightTheme.ts`, `darkTheme.ts` and the `global.css`, the global and lightTheme are super related, if you edit the global one, you should edit the lightTheme one (right now idk how to improve this).
